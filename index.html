    <h2>Reasons to adopt an older dog...</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Senior dogs are already housebroken.</li>
      <li>More mellow and require less exercise.</li>
      <li>Already trained and can still learn more!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When you’re thinking about picking up a dog from your local shelter, don’t look past the older dogs. They make great pets for a number of reasons!<br>
    <strong>Senior dogs are already housebroken.</strong> That's right, no need to have to potty-train the older ones! They already learned and it will save you the headache and the cleanups! Senior dogs are <strong>more mellow and require less exercise.</strong> You won't have to worry about coming home to find your sofa chewed up or a restless pup that requires an hour of exercise! Senior dogs are <strong>already trained and can still learn more</strong>. Dogs can be trained at any age and older dogs are just as smart as younger ones. Older dogs have a greater attention span than a puppy, which make them easier to train.</p>
